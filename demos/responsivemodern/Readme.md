## demos/responsivemodern

The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how to correctly use the responsive plugin and set responsive configs correctly.

This is a modified version of the scaffolding app which is generated by Sencha.

The syntax is as followed:
sencha -sdk ext generate app SomeApp demos/someapp -modern

The scaffolding sets a store in the app/store folder (Personnel.js)

I created a ViewModel for List and set the store in that file, which I find is better when your store doesn't need to be shared across views.

Main.js and List.js contain the necessary configs to implement responsive layouts.

It's very simple to do once the proper configs are figured out.

To test this, you could use your mobile device, but if all if you have at your disposal is  desktop machine, using Chrome or Firefox, 
you can use the console's debugger and change the device you test for such as an Android, etc.  
There is an orientation button also available and you can easily see the responsive plugin in action.

The console will also provide feedback.
